# JEDI:
An experimental language using Scala to provide many features found in modern languages.

·       Lambdas, closures, and static scoping

·       Eager and lazy execution

·       Blocks

·       Variables

·       Objects

·       Dynamic type checking


Jedi's read-execute-print loop (REPL) repeatedly:

1.     reads an expression string entered by the user,

2.     parses it into an expression object,

3.     executes the object,

4.     then prints the resulting value
